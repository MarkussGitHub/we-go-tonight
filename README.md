## Local setup
- in terminal `copy settings.local.template settings.local.yaml` and change token to your own for testing
- `poetry install`

## TO DO
- add a recursive function of searching through JSON file if possible, when pressing NEXT in any event type in the menu, the same function of event type is called. If a customer knows exactly what place he wants, he will use /search function (added later). Menu is just for exploring. If it is not possible, just list all the events from the according event_type subkey
